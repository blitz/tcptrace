To add a file to the regression tests, please add the file to the input/
directory and then create an entry for the test file in the appropriate
format file; for instance, if adding a tcpdump file, create a line in
tcpdump_files that contains the filename of the new input file.  This
will allow tcptrace to only test file formats that are compiled in.
