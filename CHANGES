3.2.2 - Late 1996
  added better checking for looking too far into truncated
    packets

3.2.3 - Thu Jan 23, 1997
  added a lot more truncation checking!

3.2.4 - Tue Feb  4, 1997
  changed plotter.c:HostLetter(ix)
	to support unlimited (26**8) different endpoints (for mallman)
  fixes from Bill Fenner, thanks
	fixed bug in va_start/va_end in DoPlot.
	fixed bug with temporary colors not being done correctly
		when using text.  Caused by Changes to xplot at last

3.2.5 - Wed Feb  5, 1997
  fixed small "off by one" error introduced by the LAST fix
3.2.6 - Thu Feb 13, 1997
  fixed small bug in etherpeek reading.  slicelength stored as "0" when
  entire packet was grabbed, didn't work before, now it does.
3.2.7 - Fri Feb 14, 1997
  fixes from Jeff Semke, PSC
    fixed bug in output.c that make it fail on some machines
    added FDDI support (untested by me, don't have FDDI)
    added Makefile flags so that it will compile on a "NetBSD 1.2 on a
	Pentium box"  (also untested by me, I don't have one)
  an HP compiler picked out some places where I missed a static
    decl for some functions.  Not fatal, but I fixed it.
3.2.8 - Tue Mar  4, 1997
  added changes for Mark
     allow connection reuse on same pair of IP addresses and ports
     4 minutes must have passed and either new segment has a SYN
     or old connection had seen both FINs
  added fix to tcptrace.c so that ^C processing is re-enabled after
     all packets read so that the output can be killed from the
     keyboard
  fix by Bill Fenner - Endian boo boo caused PC's not to read
     any packets.
  removed the "-m" option and made all of the array structures
     resizable (now supports an "infinite" number of connections)
  changed elapsed() routine to return double to prevent overflow
     of microsecond stored in a long int
3.2.9 - Wed Mar  5, 1997
  changes by Rich Jones at HP to run under HPUX
     mostly fixed the non-ansii standard
	#endif FOO
       to be
	#endif /* FOO */
  fixed minor printing bug, 1323 flags printed wrong
  fixed snoop and netm so that they worked on PC's
	(more byte sex problems)
3.2.10 - Thu Mar 27, 1997
  Mark "pushed" segments on TSG plots
    top arrow is red instead of white
  Compute slow-start window size (should be one except for "new" tcp's)
  Compute estimated congestion window
3.2.11a - Mon Mar 31, 1997
  Fixed bug is TS options are not 4-byte aligned
  Fixed tick printing (bad % value) for HUGE files (millions of packets)
