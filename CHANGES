3.2.7 - Fri Feb 14, 1997
  fixes from Jeff Semke, PSC
    fixed bug in output.c that make it fail on some machines
    added FDDI support (untested by me, don't have FDDI)
    added Makefile flags so that it will compile on a "NetBSD 1.2 on a
	Pentium box"  (also untested by me, I don't have one)
  an HP compiler picked out some places where I missed a static
    decl for some functions.  Not fatal, but I fixed it.
3.2.8 - Tue Mar  4, 1997
  added changes for Mark
     allow connection reuse on same pair of IP addresses and ports
     4 minutes must have passed and either new segment has a SYN
     or old connection had seen both FINs
  added fix to tcptrace.c so that ^C processing is re-enabled after
     all packets read so that the output can be killed from the
     keyboard
  fix by Bill Fenner - Endian boo boo caused PC's not to read
     any packets.
  changed elapsed() routine to return double to prevent overflow
     of microsecond stored in a long int
