Probably.  It appears that you're doing the "packet grabbing" on the
same machine that's hosting the connection.  That's a problem under
SunOS (and maybe other systems).  Their packet capturing pseudo-device
can't grab both ends of a connection whose home is the local machine.
I never can remember which end it omits, but given your output, it
appears that it can't see packets SENT by the local host.  The easiest
solution is to run tcpdump on a machine OTHER than the ones you're
monitoring.

The "diamond" means that the segment was sent with a PUSH (so most

Yes, this is a problem.  The only way to do it is to add invisible
points outside the normal range, xplot won't let me control the area
otherwise.  In this particular case, however, there's an easy
solution: use the middle mouse button to move the graph so that the
lower corner all shows.  Using this, you can scroll anywhere on the
screen, even outside the boundaries of the points being plotted.

I'm sorry, I don't keep up on Microsoft software.  Lots of people have
asked me this question and I don't know the answer.  I'm pretty sure
that tcpdump does NOT run under NT.  The only packet-grabbing software 
that I'm aware of for Wintel machines is etherpeek (Windows/NT/Mac):

	http://www.aggroup.com/

It's nice software, but it's commercial.

:-)

Yes, that's why it's called _TCP_trace!!!  Seriously, I've never had
any reason to look at UDP packets.  Tcptrace was designed to explore
TCP's protocol details and there's not much protocol detail to UDP to
look into.

(update, version 5 DOES support UDP a little, but you need to add the
"-u" option, as it ignores UDP by default)

If you want really good data from tcpdump, you need to run it on a
machine on the same LAN as the tcp sender, but NOT on the same
machine.  You also need to make sure that the data that you're writing
is going to a local file system, rather than a remote file system,
which would cause extra network traffic.

From what you describe, I'm assuming that you're running tcpdump on
the SAME machine as one connection endpoint.  I've never seen a case
in which running tcpdump on a reasonably fast machine would slow it
down enough to cause that sort of degradation.  One other possibility
is that the machine is busy enough that tcpdump is not seeing all the
packets (which IS common, the kernel drops them if tcpdump gets
behind).  Tcptrace only counts the packets that it sees, so if it only
sees half of them, its throughput estimate will be off by half.

The other possibility that I alluded to is that you're writing the
packet data to a file system on a different machine.  That competing
network traffic might congest the network enough to skew the results.


>> And a last question: In case of TPUT which line should I consider?
>> I suspect it should be the blue one.

That's the running average.  Network throughput is difficult to
represent discretely.  Normally, you take bytes/second over a short
period of time.  The blue line is a running average of that figure
from the beginning of the connection.  If you want a numeric answer,
just use "-l" with tcptrace and look at the figure that it prints
out.

Just a note about these files.  The magic first line that gets created on
them is nonstandard.  The first line of a postscript file is supposed to
look like:

#!PS (and possibly more stuff)

but xplot generates

#!POSTSCRIPT

That's not correct, but some older printers don't mind.  My experience
with newer printers is that they WON'T recognize it and will misbehave
in annoying ways.  If you change the first like to #!PS it'll work
fine.  If you have the xplot source, you might as well fix this and
recompile (that's what I always do).

>> I just installed tcptrace and xplot, but I'm having trouble 
>> figuring out how to load the neat plots into xplot?

There's not much to it.  Tcptrace creates plot files with the suffix
".xpl".  To see a single plot:

    xplot a2b_tsg.xpl

a VERY nice feature for lining up plots is the "-x" which locks all
graphs to the same X axis.  For example, you can:

    xplot -x a2b_tsg.xpl  b2a_tsg.xpl

and it'll show you BOTH plots.  When you zoom in on one, the other
zooms in too.  Very handy, particularly if you line them up across you 
screen like:

if you see something that doesn't look much like that, make sure that

It's just from the port numbers.  RFC 1700 

	http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/htbin/rfc/rfc1700.html

gives the official purposes of all of the low-numbered ports.  Unix
machines usually have a subset of this document in /etc/services,
which is where snoop et. al. get their application information.  If
you have a lot of traffic on official ports that AREN'T in this file,
If you can add more entries and make the snoop (and tcptrace)
information easier to read.

>> [...referring to the TSG graphs...] interpretation of some of the

"3" is a triple duplicate ACK, the kind of thing that usually triggers 
fast retransmit in the sender.

The "diamonds" are probably what you're seeing at the tops of some of
the data segments.  That means the segment was sent with a PUSH.

>> From the code, there are a bunch of types of ACKS and things. A
>> bunch of different colors as well.

SACKs are purple, normal ACKs are green.  SYNs and FINs are orange
(unless they're retransmitted, then they're red)

If there's a blue diamond on an ACK, that means that it doesn't create 
a usable RTT sample (because something that preceeded that data was
retransmitted)

If there's a red diamond on an ACK, it ALSO means that there's no RTT
sample for it, but in this case it's because the data being ACKed was
retransmitted.

You can store commonly-used tcptrace arguments in "~/.tcptracerc"

>> it seems to be running VERY slowly, and using very little CPU time

It might be stuck trying to resolve IP addresses.  Try running it with
"-n" to NOT resolve.  I almost always use "-n" when looking at
non-local traces.  It sometimes takes FOREVER to resolve the names
otherwise.

A quick check of what it's doing is to use the "-t" option that gives
you visual feedback of its progress; it displays the number of packets
processed so far, percentage done (unless compressed), and the
"elapsed trace file time".  If it's not doing at least several hundred
packets per second, then it's probably stuck doing DNS lookups.
============================================================
Wed Dec 16, 1998

>> with "-t", why is the the percentage done more than 100%

Probably one of:

1) If it's a live file, ie one that tcpdump is currently writing, then the
   "percentage done" is based on the original size of the file.  As
   such, depending on how fast the file is growing compared to the
   horsepower of the processor, the figure might be way off.

2) If it's a compressed file, tcptrace doesn't know how long it'll be.  For
   gzipped files of headers only, it usually runs up to around 100%+275% (or
   almost 4 to one compression).

>> What are "post-loss acks"?

Tcptrace tries to gather _ALL_ RTT samples, not just some of them as
several TCP implementations do.  I called the case causing trouble
"Post Loss":

  Post-loss: an ACK arrives for a segment that was only xmitted once.
   However, at least one of the segments that preceeded it was
   retransmitted, so this ACK was delayed until a CUMACK could be
   sent.  This is not a valid RTT sample therefore.

tcptrace counts them and (optionally) marks them on the TSG output,
but otherwise ignores them

This is some pretty old stuff that probably isn't useful anymore.
When I first started looking at this, I was studying some TCP's
without the Karn/Partridge stuff in them and this was a big deal.

The point was to gather some stats about RTTs that might be confused
by older TCPs, those that were taking samples from "ambiguous ACKs"
(those for segments that were retransmitted).  For those ACKs, I kept
track separately of the max,min,avg,stdev.  For the other RTT stats,
those ACKs are ignored, as expected.

I agree that the text is confusing, but I think that it's accurate
given that explanation.

>> Is it possible to use it for monitoring the whole traffic between
>> two hosts (from and to all ports) in one throughput graph?

The traffic module can do that.  First, you'd need to generate a dump
file that contained ONLY the traffic between those two hosts (how to
do that will depend on the kind of file).  Assuming it's a tcpdump
file, you could:

  tcpdump -r oldfile -w newfile host THEHOST1 and host THEHOST2

then just use something like

	tcptrace -xtraffic" -B" newfile

to get bytes/second between the hosts for all traffic.

That's a sanity check.  It means that tcptrace saw 2 packets with the
same TCP header and identical ID fields at the IP level.  Because the
IP headers (IPv4) are the same, it's unlikely that this is a
retransmission.  Most likely, it means that those packets are crossing
the local network twice, as in:

       Router                Sender                  Receiver
         |                     |                         |
       ==========================================================
pkt1:    ^---------------------<
pkt2:    >-----------------------------------------------^

once from the sender to a router (or hub), and then again from the router to
the receiver.  Tcptrace flags the situation because otherwise those packets would
be seen as retransmissions when they really aren't.  If you're seeing a lot of
these (well, probably any at all), then there's a bad setup on your network.

The title of that plot is misleading and is titled "outstanding data"
in the version that I'm working on now.  There's a high probability
that what it's plotting is similar to the sender's congestion window,
but in fact it is just a heuristic that plots the amount of non-acked
data on the network (the different between the highest byte sent and
the highest byte ACKed).

>> Can I use the program in "real-time" mode?

Sort of, but it depends on what you're trying to do.  For example:

	tcpdump -s4096 -w- | tcptrace -e stdin

will create data files for all connections as they're opened.  For
functions that give answers WHILE processing, this works fine.  For
functions that don't answer until they're done, this will require a
little more fiddling.  For example:

	tcpdump -c100 -s4096 -w- | tcptrace -e -l stdin

for grab the next 100 packets and then stop, while extracting the
contents and then doing a "long" output listing.
