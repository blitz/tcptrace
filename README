tcptrace is a TCP connection analysis tool.  It can tell you detailed
information about TCP connections by sifting through dump files.  The
dump file formats supported are:
   Sun's snoop format
   Standard tcpdump format (you need pcap library)
   Macintosh Etherpeek format
   HP/NetMetrix protocol analysis format

To see the graphs, you'll also need Tim Shepard's xplot program,
available on mercury.lcs.mit.edu:
	ftp://mercury.lcs.mit.edu/pub/shep 

As this is the first public release of tcptrace, the installation
procedure is fairly raw.  There's a standard Makefile here.  The
program has been successfully compiled on various Sun platforms here
using GCC.  I'd love to hear from people who have problems (preferably
with solutions!!!).

Most of the rest of the Docs are on the web.  Check out:

Supported Platforms
-------------------

The program is developed here at OU on Sparc machines running Solaris 2.5
It has also been tested at OU under
  i486 NetBSD 1.1
  NetBSD 1.1
  sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3
  FreeBSD 2.2.1 (no longer have access to this)

Bill Fenner has been keeping the FreeBSD "port" up to date, see:
	http://www.freebsd.org/ports/net.html

I'm also told that it can be compiled on HP systems, but I don't have
access to one for testing.


Running the program
-------------------

Some simple examples:

0) What are the args and what do they mean???
     tcptrace 

1) Run the program quickly over a dump file
     tcptrace dumpfile

2) Get longer output
     tcptrace -l dumpfile

3) Generate lots of pretty plot files (you need xplot to see them)
     tcptrace -G dumpfile

4) Print the segment contents as you go
     tcptrace -p dumpfile

5) Print progress info (useful for large files)
     tcptrace -t dumpfile

Of course, you can chain arguments together until you get just what
you want.  


Let me know what you think....

==================================================

Special thanks to the following people who helped, pointed out bugs,
or ported the program to other architectures:

	 Sita Menon 
		wrote much of the early retransmission counting
		and sequencing engine
	 Brian Wilson 
		wrote the original etherpeek capture library
	 Mark Allman and Chris Hayes 
		provided valuable (sometimes incessant!) feedback
		on the tool (and drew the nice web page graphic)
	 Tim Shepard 
		for writing xplot, of course, providing
	      	a wonderful tool for understanding TCP
	 Bill Fenner (fenner@parc.xerox.com)
		pointed out a couple small bugs in version 3.2.1
		pointed out a bug in 3.2.5 that kept it from reading
			any packets on a PC (endian bug)
	 Jeff Semke (semke@psc.edu)
		sent me diffs to get it compile under
			"NetBSD 1.2 on a Pentium box."
	 Rick Jones (raj@hpisrdq.cup.hp.com)
		sent me diffs to get it to compile on HP systems
